# Roctopus

With Roctopus, we can connect to a machine and now the status of the machine. If you try to log in and someone else is logged in you won't be able to log in and kick them out. It will also not log you in if TestExecute is running. Make sure PowerShell remoting is turned on on the remote machine.
